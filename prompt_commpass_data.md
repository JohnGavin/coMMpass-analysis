CoMMpass Study as part of the MMRF Immune Atlas research program
CoMMpass represents the largest longitudinal genomic dataset in multiple myeloma
MMRF’s CureCloud, a first-of-its-kind registry, has amassed clinical, genomic, immune, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data across more than 1,000 participants
