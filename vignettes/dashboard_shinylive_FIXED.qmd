## About This Dashboard

This is an interactive dashboard for exploring CoMMpass multiple myeloma analysis results, running entirely in your web browser using Shinylive (WebAssembly). No R server required!

**Features:**
- Quality Control visualization
- Differential Expression analysis
- Survival Analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves  
- Pathway Enrichment results
- All analysis runs in your browser

**Note:** First load may take 30-60 seconds while packages download. Subsequent visits will be faster due to caching.
